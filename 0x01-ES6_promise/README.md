# 0x01. ES6 Promises

## Description

This project is about working with ES6 Promises in JavaScript. The tasks in this project involve creating and handling promises, as well as using asynchronous functions like `async`/`await` to handle operations that resolve after a delay.

The goal of this project is to understand:
- How to create and use Promises
- The `then`, `catch`, and `finally` methods for handling Promises
- How to use the `async`/`await` syntax for asynchronous functions
- Handling multiple promises and handling errors using `try`/`catch`

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain:
- What Promises are, why they are used, and how they work
- How to use the `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods of a Promise
- How to handle multiple promises using the `Promise.all()` method
- How to handle errors using `try`/`catch` and the `throw` statement
- The usage of the `async`/`await` syntax

## Requirements

- All files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Your code will be tested using Jest and ESLint
- Your code should use the `js` extension and adhere to strict linting rules

## Setup

1. **Install NodeJS 12.11.x:**
   ```bash
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
   sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
