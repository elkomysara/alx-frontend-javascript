# ES6 Data Manipulation

This project is focused on using modern JavaScript (ES6) features for data manipulation. The key learning objectives include using array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`, understanding typed arrays, and utilizing data structures such as `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap`.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Use `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` for array manipulation.
- Understand and use Typed Arrays.
- Work with `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap` data structures in JavaScript.

## Requirements
- All your files will be executed on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **NodeJS 12.11.x**.
- Allowed editors: **vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code**.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the `.js` extension.
- Your code will be tested using **Jest** and the command `npm run test`.
- Your code will be verified against lint using **ESLint**.
- You need to pass all the tests and lint checks by running `npm run full-test`.
- All your functions must be exported.
